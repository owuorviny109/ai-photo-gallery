# Initial Release: Complete AI Photo Gallery System

## Overview
This commit introduces a fully functional AI-powered photo gallery application built on AWS serverless architecture. The system automatically analyzes uploaded images using AWS Rekognition and displays them with AI-generated labels and confidence scores.

## Architecture Components

### Infrastructure (Terraform)
- **S3 Buckets**: Separate buckets for image storage and frontend hosting
- **Lambda Functions**: Three serverless functions handling upload URLs, image analysis, and gallery API
- **DynamoDB**: NoSQL database storing image metadata and AI analysis results
- **API Gateway**: RESTful APIs for upload and gallery operations
- **IAM Roles**: Secure permissions for cross-service communication

### Backend Services
- **Upload Lambda**: Generates presigned S3 URLs for secure image uploads
- **Analysis Lambda**: Processes S3 events, calls Rekognition, stores results in DynamoDB
- **Gallery Lambda**: Retrieves analyzed images with fresh presigned URLs for viewing

### Frontend Application
- **React Application**: Modern SPA with Vite build system
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling framework
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly gallery interface
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatic gallery refresh after uploads

## Key Features

### Image Processing Pipeline
- Secure direct-to-S3 uploads using presigned URLs
- Automatic trigger of AI analysis on upload completion
- AWS Rekognition integration for object and scene detection
- Confidence scoring for all detected labels
- Persistent storage of analysis results

### User Interface
- Tabbed navigation between upload and gallery views
- Grid-based responsive image gallery
- AI label display with confidence percentages
- Upload progress feedback and error handling
- Automatic gallery refresh after successful uploads

### Security & Performance
- CORS-enabled APIs for cross-origin requests
- Private S3 bucket with presigned URL access
- Pay-per-request DynamoDB billing for cost optimization
- Lambda cold start optimization
- Error handling and retry mechanisms

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow
1. User uploads image through React frontend
2. Frontend requests presigned URL from Upload Lambda
3. Image uploads directly to S3 bucket
4. S3 event triggers Analysis Lambda
5. Analysis Lambda calls AWS Rekognition
6. Results stored in DynamoDB with Decimal precision
7. Gallery Lambda serves analyzed images with fresh URLs
8. Frontend displays images with AI-generated labels

### AWS Services Integration
- **S3**: Object storage with event notifications
- **Lambda**: Serverless compute with environment variables
- **Rekognition**: AI-powered image analysis
- **DynamoDB**: NoSQL database with pay-per-request billing
- **API Gateway**: HTTP API with CORS support
- **IAM**: Fine-grained permissions and roles
